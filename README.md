# Workshop-2-Sensors-and-Sound

On November 21st, we will be hosting a creative coding workshop, where we will be working with Processing to manipulate sound outputs using sensor inputs. In doing so, you will be introduced to the Processing Sound library and the Firmata protocol.

We will provide some examples, but if you want to use your own audio files to play around with, collect them in folder on your computer so you have them ready for the workshop (preferably .mp3 or .wav)

To save time during the workshop, please have the latest version of the Processing IDE installed (download link: https://processing.org/download/), and if you are new to Processing (or coding in general), you can get a head start by completing however much you want of the following tutorial: https://hello.processing.org/editor/
